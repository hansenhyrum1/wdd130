      <h2>Home page</h2>
      <!-- <p>This home page will hold basic information regarding soil and ground covering and when to use each. It will also include a tool for calculating the amount of material that one may need. It will show some tips and tricks and even some tools that you can use or rent in order to make things go faster.</p> -->

We provide information and examples regarding soils, rocks, and bark. Everyone has a dream landscape or yard and we are here to help you accomplish that dream. Follow the different tabs on our site to learn new information about options for your yard.</p>
      <h3>Soils</h3>
      <p>Soil mixtures can greatly increase the production and health of plants, as well as making a structral foundation for buildings and roads. Determining the right soil can be a difficult and even life-changing decisison. We will help you to find the right soil without use of highly expensive equipment or techniques.</p>
      <h3>Rock</h3>
      <p>Rocks, boulders, or pebbles can be a great asthetic addition to any landscape and can also be the base layer for many types of infrastructure. We can help you determine what type of rock and how to get it distributed.</p>
      <h3>Bark</h3>
      <p>Some of the best looking landscapes include bark as a top-dressing to beautify flower beds and help control weeds. Finding the right kind of bark is our specialty!</p>

      <h2>Ground Cover</h2>
      <!-- <p>This page will hold all the materials including rocks and bark that are not soils, but a ground cover type of bulk material. It will list the different types and maintenance and care of them. It will also show that you can add a weed mat ground covering to the area in order to prevent weeds form coming up through your ground cover.</p> -->
      <p>All ground cover, Bark and Rocks, can help to prevent weeds by blocking the growth of weeds up through the soil. Neither can do it perfectly, so it is always recommened to use weed control fabric underneath these ground covers, or else use some sort of vegetation control. Finding the colors of ground cover are based entirely on your preferences as only artifical materials will change color or fade over time.</p>
      <h3>Barks</h3>
      <p>Barks are a popular top dressing to garden and flower beds and options include nugget, shredded, and fine barks. These can be trucked in and distributed using wheelbarrows and buckets or a new technology called bark-blowing may be used. Trucks that work alike reverse vaccum cleaners use large tubes to evenly distribute bark across large areas. </p>
      <h3>Rocks</h3>
      <p>Rocks are a great decorative material to place in flower beds, walkways, drainage, patios, and more. There are colored riverstones, boulders, gravel, and sands. These are normally distributed with heavy equipment and tractors, but in some cases, such as a driveway, a dump truck and leave an evenly distributed path of rock.</p>

      <h2>Soil</h2>
      <h3>Permeability</h3>
      <p>Permeability means the amount of water and air that can pass through the soils. A good soil has a good permeability that retains moisture, but also lets it pass through to the underlying sub-soils. Sands help water to pass through the soil and clays help to retain that moisture.</p>
      <h3>Nutrients</h3>
      <p>The different types of nutrients in the soil can be attributed to the organic materials found within it. Manure, compost, and aged bark all help to add different types of nutrients and organic material to the soil.</p>
      <h3>Soil PH</h3>
      <p>The PH of a soil measures the level of acidity or base in the soil. It is important to see what PH level works best for your plants, as it can be a huge determiner on the amount of fruit and color plants.</p>
