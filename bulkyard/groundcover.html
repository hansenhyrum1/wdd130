                    <h2>Barks</h2>
                    <p>Barks are a popular top dressing to garden and flower beds and options include nugget, shredded, and fine barks. These can be trucked in and distributed using wheelbarrows and buckets or a new technology called bark-blowing may be used.

                    <h2>Ground Cover</h2>
                    <p>All ground cover, Bark and Rocks, can help to prevent weeds by blocking the growth of weeds up through the soil. Neither can do it perfectly, so it is always recommened to use weed control fabric underneath these ground covers, or else use some sort of vegetation control. Finding the colors of ground cover are based entirely on your preferences as only artifical materials will change color or fade over time.</p>
